    abstract = "{Rank aggregation (RA), the process of combining multiple ranked lists into a single ranking, has played an important role in integrating information from individual genomic studies that address the same biological question. In previous research, attention has been focused on aggregating full lists. However, partial and/or top ranked lists are prevalent because of the great heterogeneity of genomic studies and limited resources for follow-up investigation. To be able to handle such lists, some ad hoc adjustments have been suggested in the past, but how RA methods perform on them (after the adjustments) has never been fully evaluated. In this article, a systematic framework is proposed to define different situations that may occur based on the nature of individually ranked lists. A comprehensive simulation study is conducted to examine the performance characteristics of a collection of existing RA methods that are suitable for genomic applications under various settings simulated to mimic practical situations. A non-small cell lung cancer data example is provided for further comparison. Based on our numerical results, general guidelines about which methods perform the best/worst, and under what conditions, are provided. Also, we discuss key factors that substantially affect the performance of the different methods.}",

This chapter discusses the several classes of sentence-generating devices that are closely related, in various ways, to the grammars of both natural languages and artificial languages of various kinds. By a language it simply mean a set of strings in some finite set V of symbols called the vocabulary of the language. By a grammar a set of rules that give a recursive enumeration of the strings belonging to the language. It can be said that the grammar generates these strings. The chapter discusses the aspect of the structural description of a sentence, namely, its subdivision into phrases belonging to various categories. A major concern of the general theory of natural languages is to define the class of possible strings; the class of possible grammars; the class of possible structural descriptions; a procedure for assigning structural descriptions to sentences, given a grammar; and to do all of this in such a way that the structural description assigned to a sentence by the grammar of a natural language will provide the basis for explaining how a speaker of this language would understand this sentence."
